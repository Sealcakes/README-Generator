# Professional README Generator

## Description

This project was a lot of fun to work on!  Getting into using Node and Node Package Manager was a lot of fun to figure out!  My motivation was to bring an open-source project that would assist programmers that need a little assistance when getting their README files put together.
The Professional README Generator sovles the problem of getting a professional looking README file put together to go over the finer points of your new project!  

## Installation

In order to run this program you will need to install Inquirer v8.2.4 from npm

## Usage

Use the .GIF below to understand using this program.  It is fairly simple and once you have installed inquirer and ran the program using "node index.js" the command line will prompt you the rest of the way.
